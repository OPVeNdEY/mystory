Imaria was born to the family of Opoki Riale in the village of Ebewen. He was a very beautiful and active child when he was born, but, one day, polio struck and disabled him. There was no prevention at that time. The mother took him to every doctor in Ebewen in the hope that one of them might be able to cure her son. After days of searching, it appeared that none of the doctors had the ability to rescue Imaria from the wrath of this disease. However, Imaria soon recovered, even though he now lacked the ability to walk.
